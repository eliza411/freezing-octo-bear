Learning Git and Python

We're mostly working on Windows machines here, so to set up:

Install Python 3
================

1. Visit http://www.python.org/download
2. Download Python 3.3.2 Windows x86 MSI Installer (32-bit is required by Pygames)
3. Install, select "Add python.exe to Path", accepting all other defaults

Install the Pygame Libraries
============================

1. Visit https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads
2. Dowload pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py3.3.msi
3. Install, accepting all the defaults

Add Python to your path post install
=======================

In your Git shell, you may want to run Python from the commandline. To make it easy, you'll add Python to your path if you didn't select the option during the Python install.

1. Locate the path for Python (Start > All programs > Python33 > Python (commandline) > Properties and copy it. It's something like C:/Python33/
2. Go to Start > Computer, right-click, then choose Properties. 
3. Choose Advanced system settings and on the Advanced tab, choose Environment variables
4. Find the Path variable and at the end, add a semicolon (;), then enter the path to Python and save.
5. Exit your bash shell and re-enter.
6. Test by running the program
