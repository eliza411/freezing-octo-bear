Learning Git and Python

We're mostly working on Windows machines here, so to set up:

Install Python 3
================

1. Visit http://www.python.org/download
2. Download Python 3.3.1 Windows x86 MSI Installer (32-bit is required by Pygames)
3. Install, accepting all the defaults

Install the Pygame Libraries
============================

1. Visit http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
2. Under the Windows heading, dowload pygame-1.9.2a0.win32.2.msi
3. Install, accepting all the defaults

Add Python to your path
=======================

In your Git shell, you may want to run Python from the commandline. To make it easy, you'll add Python to your path.

1. Locate the path for Python (Start > All programs > Python32 > Python (commandline) > Properties and copy it. It's something like C:/Python32/
2. Go to Start > Computer, right-click, then choose Properties. 
3. Choose Advanced system settings and on the Advanced tab, choose Environment variables
4. Find the Path variable and at the end, add a semicolon (;), then enter the path to Python and save.
5. Exit your bash shell and re-enter.
6. Test by running the program
